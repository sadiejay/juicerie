## Getting Started

To work on the site, first [clone the repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository). After switching to your local copy of the repository in terminal, run the following command to install project dependencies:

```sh
npm run setup
```

<br/>

Optionally, you can run the following (the above command compiles the following scripts):

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
bundle install
```

```sh
npm update uswds
```

```sh
npm run uswds-copy-assets
```

```sh
npm run uswds-build-sass
```

<br/>

Now that all of your dependencies are installed, run:
 ```sh
 npm run watch
 ```

- This runs a series of commands that watches for any changes in both USWDS node module and the root level asset folders in this repo.

<br/>

Finally, start your local server by running the following command:

```sh
npm run serve
```
   - `npm run serve` or `npm start -- --incremental`: Runs your local server with incremental regeneration enabled to greatly improve build time. Use instead of `npm start`.
