       Research shows that heart disease is the #1 cause of death for women. Alongside heart health we also wanted to highlight brain, gut, skin, and colon wellness to help Juicers easily align their internal health needs with their juice. People these days are looking to receive professional medical care while also taking their health into their own hands in a more holistic way. The Juicerie app helps our Juicers by quickly matching a recipe to support their health needs in an easy and accessible way. In short, The Juicerie is a web app that brings ease and convenience into the lives of our Juicers. When someone wants to focus on improving their gut health for example, theyâ€™ll simply be able to select their intention and receive a tailored juice recipe to support their needs.
